# solid-drawer

[![pnpm](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-pnpm-cc00ff.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pnpm)](https://pnpm.io/)

This library is a port of https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul for solid JS.\
Instead of radix it is built on top of the kobalte https://github.com/kobaltedev/kobalte/ libraries dialog component.\
The "vaul" library has been modified to utilize solids fine grained reactivity vs. relying on direct style-manipulation of a ref.
